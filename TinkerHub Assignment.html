<p> My name is Nidal Yoonus, S2 CSE currently residing in Kalamassery, Ernakulam. Websites has always fasicnatsd me from when I was kid. I always wondered how they worked and who made them. Therefore I look forward to this event conducted by Tinkerhub KMEA and IEDC and I thank them for giving me such an opportunity and I hope to attend this event offline. </p>
